* In this Project we have learn some new hooks like 'useCallback' , 'useEffect' , 'useRef' and hamara poorana wala hook i.e 'useState' hook

* 'useCallback' hook => used for Memoization , Optimization. isme hamare function ko cache memory mai rkhta hai 'useCallback' hook. cache mai rkhne ka benefit ye hai ki next time agar iski 'dependency array' mai kuch bhi changes ho or agr hamara method run ho too hamaara method ko kese bhi krke optimise kro

  Definition on React Dev =>  useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
         what does this upper line means?  =>
         ANS BY CHATGPT :
          In React, components can re-render multiple times based on changes to state or props. When a component re-renders, all the functions inside it are redefined. This can be inefficient, especially if those functions are passed as props to child components, which could cause unnecessary re-renders of those children.

        The useCallback Hook helps optimize performance by returning a memoized version of the callback function. This memoized function only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This can be useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

        Here's what it means, broken down:

        React Hook: A function provided by React to allow you to hook into React's state and lifecycle features from function components.
        cache a function definition: Store the function in such a way that it doesn't get recreated on every render.
        between re-renders: Across multiple renders of the component, the function remains the same if the dependencies havenâ€™t changed.

        NOTE : this upper explanation of 'useCallback' is taken from chatGPT

        FINAL NOTE : iss project mai hamne 'useCallback' Hook ka use kiya hai and isme only function ki definition hee hai function call to 'useEffect Hook' sai ho rha hai 


* 'useEffect' hook => used for the changes. mtlb ki agr inme (iski 'dependency array') isme kuch bhi ched chaad ho rhi hai or agr hamara method call ho rha hai too dubara sai run krdo uss method ko

    definition by CHATGPT :
    The useEffect Hook in React lets you perform side effects in your function components. Side effects are operations that affect something outside the scope of a function, such as fetching data, updating the DOM, or setting up subscriptions.


* NOTE : both 'useCallback' and 'useEffect' hooks are totally different. 
  'useCallback' => used for optimisation and memoization
  useEffect' => not used for optimisation it re run the whole method on slight change also.


  * 'useRef' Hook => used to take the reference.
      iss Project mai hamne 'useRef' hook ka use isliye hee kiya tha kyoki hamm hamare Generated password ka reference ekk variable mai store karwa ske and then then uss password ka reference use krr ske. Hamne iss Project mai Generated input Password ka reference kaha par use kiyya hai?? => JAB HAMNE GENERATED INPUT PASSWORD KO SELECT KARWAYA (Highlight karwaya) JISSE 'UI' mai user ko acha dikhe. bss isilie hamne yaha par 'useRef' Hook ka use kiya tha iske alawa too or kuch khaas use nahi kiya hai is project mai too



  NOTE : Inn notes ke alawa 'App.jsx' bhi padhlena iss Project ki kyoki usme bhi kahi kahipe maine comments kiye hai important Notes
